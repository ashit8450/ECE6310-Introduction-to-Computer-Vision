# Assignment 1 : Convolutions, Separable Filters, Sliding Window

### Problem Statement
In this assignment, three versions of a 7x7 mean filter were used to perform convolutions. The first version uses a simple 2D convolution. The second version uses two separable filters of size 1x7 and 7x1. The third version uses separable filters along with a sliding window, to speed up the computation time.
